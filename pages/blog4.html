      <h1>Robotics, Smart Materials, and Their Future Impact for Humans</h1>

      <p>What is a robot? What is a smart material? How can these two have so much impact on
        our future lives? In this article we will examine the true potential of robotics, and soft-smart
         robotics in particular. These technologies are set to turn our perceptions of what a robot is, and how
          it can help us and the world we live in, upside down. Instead of thinking of robots as large, rigid,
          and resilient machines, we can view future robots as artificial robotic organisms that have properties mimicking,
           and greatly extending, the capabilities of natural organisms. The unique properties of softness and compliance make
           these machines highly suited to interactions with delicate things, including the human body. In addition, we will touch
           upon concepts in emerging robotics that have not been considered, including their biodegradability and regenerative energy
           transduction. How these new technologies will ultimately drive robotics and the exact form of future robots is unknown,
           but here we can at least glimpse the future impact of robotics for humans.</p>

     <p>  The nineteenth century marked the acceleration and wide adoption of industrial processes.
      At the start of the century the Industrial Revolution was in mid-swing,
       and by the end we had developed the car and were just about to demonstrate powered flight.
        The impact on the lives of humans was massive; social and economic rules that governed travel,
        health care, manufacturing, working environments, and home life were rewritten.
        In the twentieth century this process was repeated with the Technology Revolution,
        but at a much faster rate. Technology moved from the laboratory and research institute to the home</p>

      <p>  A “robot” is often defined in terms of its capability—it is a machine that can carry out a complex series of actions automatically,
        especially one programmable by a computer.
        This is a useful definition that encompasses a large proportion of conventional robots of the kind you see in science-fiction films.
         This definition, and the weight of established cultural views of what a robot is,
          has an impact on our views of what a robot could be. The best indication of this can be seen by examining cultural attitudes to robots around the world</P>
